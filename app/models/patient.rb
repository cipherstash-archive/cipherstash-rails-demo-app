  # attribute :full_name, :string
  # attribute :email, :string
  # attribute :dob, :date
  # attribute :weight, :float

  ## The rails demo uses ActiveAdmin, which uses Ransack for the filters.
  ## For the dob and weight filters to continue to work, the below types need to be added to the model.

  # ransacker :dob, type: :date
  # ransacker :weight, type: :numeric
end
